            In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began the task 
            of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among those 
            students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become master carver of 
            the institute today.<br>
            <br>
            “I'll never forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master carver, 
            Hone Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here to learn the 
            art to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive for we could lose 
            our identity.” It was exciting to be playing such an important role 
            to save Māori art,” says Clive, “everyone has a reason in life. 
            This was my reason. And that's why I'm still here over 40 years 
            later. If we lose our arts and crafts we lose our identity.”

            Harakeke (Flax) is unique to New Zealand and is one of our most ancient plant species.<br>
            <br>
            When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly discovered 
            that flax could be woven to make clothing, housing materials and 
            decorative tūrapa (panels) for their houses.
            Two native species of flax both come from the lily family. Harakeke 
            (common flax) grows up to three meters high and has firm, long 
            leaves with a fine muka fibre, ideal for all types of weaving. 
            Wharariki (mountain flax) is found along coast lines, growing up to 
            1.6 meters with softer leaves and less fibre than harakeke.<br>
            <br>
            At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills and 
            traditions of a craft hundreds of years old. “I believe weaving can 
            only be learnt the old way - by sitting, by listening, by touching 
            and by doing,” says head of the weaving school, Edna Pahewa.

            Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the 
            national carving school, under the guidance of those, such as Clive 
            Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who were once 
            institute carving students themselves.<br>
            <br>
            Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away traditional 
            Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at our National 
            Carving School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark of Authenticity. 
            We also accept carving commissions.

            Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, Māori 
            warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. Warriors used many 
            different hand weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs), 
            pouwhenua (pointed staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao 
            (short spears), huata (long spears) and patu (clubs). The long 
            weapons were carried, and the small clubs were often tucked into a 
            belt. Special weapons were sometimes given names and passed down 
            through generations.<br>
            <br>
            Wars could be fought over land and resources, but also as utu 
            (revenge) or to increase mana (prestige). There were many traditions 
            and rules to be followed during battles in earlier times. War 
            parties (taua) could range in size from a small group to a few 
            hundred people. Most battles took place in the summer months after 
            the harvesting of crops was completed. The element of surprise was 
            important, so raids often happened at dawn.
