            Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal 
            Valley states that this place was one of the area's 'Te Pupu' and 
            'Te Hoata', the Goddesses of Fire, emerged from the earth's core 
            while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded
             on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking for their 
             brother, they left part of the fire they carried, creating geysers,
            hot springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity that 
            remains today.

        <div class="div3"><img src="Mud-pool.jpg" class="grid-img" alt="Mud-pool"> </div>
        <div class="div4">The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam 
            that cause the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay 
            called kaolin. Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black 
            sulphur turns it to grey.<br>
            The activity varies with the amount of rainfall, but the temperature 
            of the steaming bursts of mud is approximately 90-95 degrees Celsius 
            (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit).

        <div class="div5"><img src="geyser.jpg" class="grid-img" alt="Geyser2"></div>
        <div class="div6">Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means 
            “Big splash” and erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is 
            semi-predictable, as she plays 15-20 minutes after another of our 
            active geysers. According to Maori culture, geysers are viewed as 
            gifts from the gods.<br>
            To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the 
            “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser - named after Prince Edward Albert 
            visited here in the 1900's. It was traditionally named the “Tohu” or 
            sign as it usually plays 10 mins before and then simultaneously with 
            Pohutu and reaches heights of up to seven metres (almost 23 feet).

            Since the first intake at Te Wānanga Whakairo, many
            young Māori from iwi (tribes) throughout New Zealand have been
            taught the Māori practice of wood carving under the expert
            guidance of master carvers who were once trainees at the school.</div>
